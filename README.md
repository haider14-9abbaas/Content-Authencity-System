# 🛡️ AI vs Human Content Detection System

A Flask-based machine learning project to detect whether uploaded content — images, videos, or text — is human-generated or created by AI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detect AI-generated vs Human-generated:
  - 🖼 Images
  - 🎥 Videos
  - 📝 Text
- 🧠 Uses Logistic Regression and TF-IDF for classification
- 📦 Built with Python, Flask, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
- 🧪 Trained on real-world AI/human datasets

## ⚙️ Run Locally

```bash
# Step 1: Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 2: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Train models (once)
python train_image_model_from_your_dataset.py
python train_video_model.py
python train_text_model.py

# Step 4: Run the app
python app.py
Then open: http://127.0.0.1:5000
